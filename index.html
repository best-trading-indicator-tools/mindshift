        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>At MindShift, your privacy and data security are our top priorities. We believe in complete transparency about how we handle your information.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Collection and Storage</h3>
        <p>We've designed MindShift with privacy in mind. Our app operates primarily on your device, meaning your personal information and usage data remain under your control. We do not maintain external servers for storing your personal data, and we do not track your usage patterns or behaviors.</p>
        
        <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
        <p>All your app data, including your progress and preferences, is stored locally on your device. This approach ensures that you maintain complete control over your information and can delete it at any time by simply uninstalling the app or using the in-app reset function.</p>
        
        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>We do not share any of your information with third parties. While the app may require certain device permissions to function properly, these are used solely for providing the intended features and nothing more.</p>
        
        <h3>Your Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>As a MindShift user, you have complete control over your data. This includes:</p>
        <p>• The right to access all your stored information through the app's interface<br>
        • The ability to delete your data at any time using the app's reset function<br>
        • The option to opt-out of any future data collection features we might add</p>
